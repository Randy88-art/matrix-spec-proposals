MSC4306: Thread Subscriptions
=====

## Background and Summary

Threads were introduced in [version 1.4 of the Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/changelog/v1.4/) as a way to isolate conversations in a room, making it easier for users to track specific conversations that they care about (and ignore those that they do not).

Thus far, there has been no good way for users to ensure that they see new messages in only the threads that they care about. The current rules only allow expressing one of two choices: users and their clients can either watch all threads, or ignore all threads.
As a result, the user is either being presented with unwanted information (misusing their attention), or they risk missing important messages.

This proposal introduces a new mechanism, Thread Subscriptions, as a first-class way for users to signal which threads they care about.

We then add a new push rule so that users can receive push notifications only for threads that they care about.


## Proposal

This proposal consists of three main parts:
- 3 simple endpoints for subscribing to and unsubscribing from threads;
- new prescribed client behaviour when the user is mentioned in a thread; and
- a new push rule (including a new push rule condition) that prevents notifying about threads that the user has not subscribed to.


### Terminology

This proposal introduces the concept of being 'subscribed' to and 'unsubscribed' from a thread.

The default state is unsubscribed.


### New Endpoints

#### Subscribing to a thread

```
PUT /_matrix/client/v1/rooms/{roomId}/thread/{eventId}/subscription
```

with request body:

```jsonc
{
  // Whether the subscription was made automatically
  // by a client, not by manual user choice.
  "automatic": true
}
```

Returns 200 with empty body `{}`.

If the thread does not exist, or if the user does not have access to it, returns 404/`M_NOT_FOUND`.

If the thread is already subscribed, then the subscription remains and:

- if `automatic` is `false`, the thread is marked as manually-subscribed, even if the existing subscription has it marked as automatically subscribed. (In other words, manual subscriptions take precedence over automatic subscriptions.)


#### Unsubscribing from a thread
```
DELETE /_matrix/client/v1/rooms/{roomId}/thread/{eventId}/subscription
```

Returns 200 with empty body `{}`.

If the thread was not subscribed, returns 200 with empty body `{}` for idempotence.

If the thread does not exist, or is inaccessible, returns 404/`M_NOT_FOUND`.


#### Retrieving thread subscription

```
GET /_matrix/client/v1/rooms/{roomId}/thread/{eventId}/subscription

{"automatic": true}
```

Retrieves the thread subscription for a given thread.

On success (200), returns:

```jsonc
{
  // Whether the subscription was automatically made or not
  "automatic": true
}
```

If there is no subscription to that thread, or the thread does not exist, or the thread is inaccessible, returns 404/`M_NOT_FOUND`.


### New Client Behaviour: subscribe on mention

When a user is mentioned in a thread (by another user â€” the *mentioning user*), the user's client should perform an automatic subscription to that thread using `PUT /subscription` with `{"automatic": true}`.

The server does not perform this action on the client's behalf, principally because the server is not able to detect mentions in encrypted rooms.

If the client is already aware of the user being subscribed to the thread, then making a `PUT /subscription` request is not necessary.

If the mentioning user is banned in the room or ignored by the user, the automatic thread subscription should not occur.

#### Reversal of automatic subscriptions

*This section is an optional aspect. Clients can choose not to implement it, particularly in scenarios where it doesn't make sense.*

If an automatic thread subscription occurs and the mentioning user is subsequently banned (or ignored by the user, but without loss of generality we refer to the user as banned hereinafter), then:

- the thread subscription should be reversed,
- provided that there aren't any other mentions by other, non-banned, users that would have caused the same automatic subscription.

When a client becomes aware of a banned user in a room, it may need to backpaginate thread history to determine whether there are any threads whose automatic subscriptions should be reversed, or to determine if there are any other qualifying mentions that would obviate the need to reverse automatic subscriptions.

For efficiency reasons, clients may limit the depth of this backpagination with an implementation-defined recency limit, owing to the observation that abuse is usually cleaned up shortly after it occurs.

### New Push Rules

As motivation, we want threads to have the following notification semantics:

- Messages in unsubscribed threads should not count as activity at all; as a user, I do not want to see the room as unread because there are new messages in an unsubscribed thread.
    - Exceptions: if the user is mentioned, this should generate a notification as usual. (The push notification thus generated is also useful for the client to realise it needs to create an automatic thread subscription.)
- Messages in subscribed threads should always count as a notification, and the (effective) room notification settings should not matter at all. E.g. the room can be muted, but if I, as a user, am subscribed to a thread, I still want to get a notification for new messages in that thread. If I do not want that, then I will unsubscribe.

To achieve this, we propose the addition of two new push rules:

1. a `content` push rule, called `.m.rule.unsubscribed_thread`, at the end of the content rule list. This rule causes events in unsubscribed threads to skip notification processing without generating a notification.
   The rule occurs after mention-specific rules and keyword mention rules, meaning that mentions continue to generate notifications.
   ```jsonc
   {
       "rule_id": ".m.rule.unsubscribed_thread",
       "default": true,
       "enabled": true,
       "conditions": [
           {
               "kind": "thread_subscription",
               "subscribed": false
           }
       ],
       "actions": []
   }
   ```
2. an `underride` push rule, called `.m.rule.subscribed_thread`, at the beginning of the underride list. This rule causes events in subscribed threads to generate notifications.
   ```jsonc
   {
       "rule_id": ".m.rule.subscribed_thread",
       "default": true,
       "enabled": true,
       "conditions": [
           {
               "kind": "thread_subscription",
               "subscribed": true
           }
       ],
       "actions": [
           "notify",
           {
               "set_tweak": "sound",
               "value": "default"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

These push rules use a new push condition `thread_subscription`, which takes an argument `subscribed` (boolean).
The `thread_subscription` push condition is satisfied if and only if all the following hold:
1. the event, which we are running push rules for, is part of a thread.
2. the user is subscribed to the thread (`subscribed` = `true`) or is not subscribed to the thread (`subscribed` = `false`).

## Limitations and Potential Future Expansions

- Users will not have enough granularity to subscribe to threads in a way that lets them keep track of threads (being able to 'catch up' through some mechanism in their client) without also getting notifications for them, except by disabling ALL thread subscription notifications altogether.
  - There is precedent for this granularity in the popular forum software *Discourse*, but the author is not aware of Instant Messaging software with this granularity.
  - With that said, this could be feasibly extended by a later MSC with no apparent issues.
- Users will not be given any functionality allowing them to permanently 'mute' a thread, preventing future automatic subscriptions.
  - This could, however, be introduced in the future as an extension to MSC.

## Alternatives

- Clients could maintain thread subscription settings in Room Account Data, as a map from event ID to the subscription settings.
    - This would be inefficient by requiring the entire subscription set for an entire room to be transferred at once, for example in Sliding Sync.
    - This would make subscriptions vulnerable to Read-Modify-Write race conditions (though this could be addressed with extensions to the Room Account Data APIs).
- Clients could maintain their thread subscription settings in their global Account Data, but this seems to be strictly worse than doing so in Room Account Data.

## Security considerations

- Abuse of 'subscribe on mention', particularly in public rooms
    - Malicious users can be ignored by the user, to stop the subscribe on mention behaviour.
    - Users can disable notifications entirely for rooms.
    - Room moderators can take action against malicious users abusing the feature.
    - If no room moderators are protecting the user, the user can of course also leave the room.

## Notes to Client Implementors

## Notes to Server Implementors

- Since clients will be automatically updating the Thread Subscription Settings when their user is mentioned, server implementations should be ready to handle concurrent updates by multiple of the user's devices/clients when they are online at the same time.

## Unstable prefix

Whilst this proposal is unstable, the following changes should be noted:

- the endpoint is renamed to `/_matrix/client/unstable/io.element.msc4306/rooms/{roomId}/thread/{eventId}/subscription`
- the push rules' IDs are renamed to:
  - `.io.element.msc4306.rule.unsubscribed_thread`
  - `.io.element.msc4306.rule.subscribed_thread`
- the push rule condition `kind` is renamed to:
  - `io.element.msc4306.thread_subscription`
